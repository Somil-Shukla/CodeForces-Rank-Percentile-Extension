# CodeForces-Rank-Percentile-Extension

The objective of this project is to create a browser extension that allows Codeforces users to see
their percentile ranking in real-time on their profile page. Percentile ranking is a powerful metric,
providing users with insight into how they compare with the entire Codeforces user base. The key
motivation behind this project is to leverage efficient algorithms and data extraction techniques to
offer users a smooth and responsive experience.
